This repository contains a toy Datalog implementation.

Very many things are wrong with it:

  • Naïve evaluation.
  • Querying isn't supported; facts are simply generated when the Datalog
    source file is loaded.
  • Arithemetic is unimplemented.

I may come back to and fix some of these things.
