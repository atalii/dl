This repository contains a toy Datalog implementation.

Very many things are wrong with it:

  • All predicates are unary.
  • Naïve evaluation.
  • Querying isn't supported; facts are simply generated when the Datalog
    source file is loaded.
  • Arithemetic is unimplemented.
  • Usual logical connectives are unimplemented. This one's important.

I may come back to and fix some of these things.
